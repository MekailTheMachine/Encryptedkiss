## Introduction to Encryption in Cryptocurrency

From encryption, we will have hopefully built a solid foundation of computers, and how encryption works on a basic level. 
Afterwards, it is important to also build a healthy foundation of financial and economical systems, to truly understand modern defi systems.
and as we merge the two concepts together, we will devlop deeper understandings of how they merge themselves. üñ•Ô∏è 

The history is long and complex but there has always been a desire to store secretive information.

The earliest use of cryptography is hieroglyphs. 

A great example was Edgar Allen Poes ‚ÄúThe Gold-Bug‚Äù which uses a simple substitution cipher.
(For more on that: http://csc.columbusstate.edu/summers/NOTES/1301/lab8-f12.pdf)

Here is a python file that will re-arrange a phrase for you with a simple Caesar algorithm:
https://github.com/MekailTheMachine/Encryptedkiss/blob/master/examples/Caesar.py
If you run the file, you can input a message, and a key value to shift the letters by. 

You can agree to rearrange every 3rd letter in a series of texts 3 times. 
People could get ahold of how a party decrypted a message or could figure it out themselves.
The game changed when computer based encryption came along, with complex algorithms that could encrypt messages one way,
but not decrypt them without a certain key. The key behind this was using exponents, and prime numbers. 
Before we get ahead of ourselves let's get a better understanding of this concept, with this abstract picture of paints:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49100995/226060626-fea1ae60-1792-4259-a377-dd5420d2b01d.png)

Say you and your friend, either Alice or Bob, are hanging around one day playing with paint.
 Life is tough at your boarding school, and you just want to communicate to your crush without having to worry about some 
bully pretending to be Alice, or Bob. You guys think you have found a way to communicate with the confidence 
that one another wrote the letter themselves, and nobody is pretending to be one another!! :Direct_Hit~1: 

You both agree to use your schools color; Egg-White that you both have access to. 
On your own though, you each make a unique red, and blue paint; (perhaps a paint separator
 could allow someone to make the same paint, but for this purpose lets assume that doesn't exist yet) 
With your own unique colors, you both take a portion and mix it with some of the white paint, 
getting a pink, and baby blue color, both still unique, since they were mixed with your unique paint.
 We will then send a vial of the new lighter color to one another. Alice will mix the baby blue from 
Bob with her pink, and get a distinct purple, as will Bob, with his baby blue. You will both now have 
a distinct and unique purple. You can send your letters with a small vial of purple paint, and
 if it matches the paint you can make with your color, you know its your friend.

When we send cryptocurrencies (let's say Alice is sending Bob some bitcoin),
 we are typically sending a message to several computers; in Alice's case she
will be asking those computers to take bitcoin from her hot pink paint color,
 and send it to Bob, and you can prove that you are hot pink, because you are
 able to make the distinct purple, while the egg-white color is really just the 
"network protocol" all the computers use to agree on being able to tell if the 
purple is the distinct purple your hot pink should be able to make. The trick to 
why computers cant separate the paint, or break the encryption, comes down to RSA-256, 
and elliptical curve cryptography, which at it's true roots is possibly because of the Euler-Zeta formula. 
(Proof: https://riemannhypothesis.info/2013/09/in-the-beginning-there-was-eulers-formula/)

Now to the nitty gritty; 
if you would like to see private key encryption in action above, we will be encrypting the message 22621,
 and then decrypting it using the private key. double asterisk indicates an exponent (example: 3 to the power of 2 is 9) 
and % is modulus which indicates the amount left over after dividing.

The reason we use primes reverts back to our Euler-Zeta formula.

Now with a more solid understanding of how encryption works, tomorrow we will look at Satoshi Nakomoto's Bitcoin White paper,
 as well as look into some of the references, to understand how encryption built up to this point, why Bitcoin was invented, and how the technology
 integrated with blockchain, and the key concepts of decentralization, how it is achieved through network consensus algorithms, and how it can change the future.

Now, let's dive into the core of our topic: blockchain technology and Bitcoin!

Follow along as we review Satoshi Nakamoto's groundbreaking Bitcoin whitepaper:
 https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper.

Traditional systems, like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube,
 store data in centralized locations controlled by server administrators or entities.
  Decentralization removes this central storage, spreading data across computers worldwide. 
  People are incentivized to help carry and add to this data through mining fees or, 
  in the case of Bitcoin, block rewards.

The data structure we'll focus on is the blockchain, 
which stores data in "blocks" containing transactions.
Once all data is verified and certain random requirements are met, 
the data is "hashed" - run through an algorithm that condenses it into an 
unpredictable 256-character string. This string starts the sequence for each 
subsequent block, linking the data together.

If any computer tries to alter past data, the hash would change, 
causing a mismatch and making the network reject the block and node. 
Blockchain technology's decentralized nature is exemplified by Bitcoin, 
as the blockchain ledger is distributed among numerous computers.

Satoshi's whitepaper outlines the problems with financial institutions 
and how they can be resolved through Bitcoin. The Merkle tree concept, 
combined with decreasing inflation rates, forces nations to develop protocols 
for situations like emergency relief programs instead of relying on inflation-based taxation.

Debates over intrinsic and extrinsic values between fiat and cryptocurrencies 
can get complicated. Money, as a representation of value, varies in importance 
between individuals. It's crucial to question whether our collective beliefs and 
values are still beneficial compared to alternative options. Over the past decade, 
we've seen an increase in Bitcoin's perceived value.

Before we delve into philosophy, let's discuss some definitions:

Intrinsic value: The value inherent in something.
Extrinsic value: The value attributed to an item, separate from its composition.

The US dollar is a good example. What are its intrinsic and extrinsic 
values before and after the Nixon-era gold standard? Currently, 
the intrinsic value of the dollar is the cotton it's made from, 
while its extrinsic value is the societal agreement on its worth.

As a society, we must question whether our current values and beliefs 
continue to benefit us compared to alternatives. We will host in-depth 
classes on financial systems and structures. If you're curious to learn more, 
feel free to reach out to our admins for recommended resources.

Centralized networks can easily store and access data in a single location. 
However, decentralized blockchain networks face challenges in efficiently 
accessing and sharing vast amounts of data among nodes. This data must be 
verified and shared with receiving nodes. By utilizing Merkle trees and cryptography, 
we arrive at the first public blockchain network, as implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto.
