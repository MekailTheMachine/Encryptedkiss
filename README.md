## Introduction to Encryption in Cryptocurrency

From encryption, we will have hopefully built a solid foundation of computers, and how encryption works on a basic level. 
Afterwards, it is important to also build a healthy foundation of financial and economical systems, to truly understand modern defi systems.
and as we merge the two concepts together, we will devlop deeper understandings of how they merge themselves. üñ•Ô∏è 

The history is long and complex but there has always been a desire to store secretive information.

The earliest use of cryptography is hieroglyphs. 

A great example was Edgar Allen Poes ‚ÄúThe Gold-Bug‚Äù which uses a simple substitution cipher.

You can agree to rearrange every 3rd letter in a series of texts 3 times. 
People could get ahold of how a party decrypted a message or could figure it out themselves.
The game changed when computer based encryption came along, with complex algorithms that could encrypt messages one way,
but not decrypt them without a certain key. The key behind this was using exponents, and prime numbers. 
Before we get ahead of ourselves let's get a better understanding of this concept, with this abstract picture of paints:
